<h1>September 20th</h1>

First, I worked on the BOM. Choosing components such as the power supply, flyback, ZVS driver, copper wire, main electrode, and 3d-printing filament. I decided on a tungsten electrode due to the plasma produced being extremely hot, at over 10,000C. The tungsten should be able to survive this in short cycles. Also, I designed the main plasma vortex in Fusion 360. The copper wire will be round in a torodial way in order to produce the vortex effect. The flyback transformer is mounted to the main build but the ZVS driver and power supply will not. I also did some research to make sure that it will actually achieve the vortex rather than arcing to a single point on the wire.
