# Plasma-Vortex
A desktop plasma-vortex machine! Utilizes a flyback transformer in order to provide the high voltage necessary.
A few thousand volts are fed into a tungsten electrode in the middle of a torodial wound copper wire. This should evenly arc in a vortex shape to get the cool 'arc-reactor' effect.
